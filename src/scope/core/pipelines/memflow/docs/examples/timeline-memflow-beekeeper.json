She is wearing a full protective white bee suit with a mesh hood, which obscures her face. She is holding a wooden frame covered with a teeming, buzzing mass of honeybees, examining the health of the hive. The air is filled with the low, constant hum of the bees and the sweet, waxy smell of honey. Her movements are slow and deliberate, a peaceful dance with thousands of tiny creatures.",

He is the beekeeper's son, and today is his first, very reluctant, lesson in the family business.",
